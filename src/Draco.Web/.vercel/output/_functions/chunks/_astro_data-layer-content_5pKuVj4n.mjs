This policy explains how information is handled within the platform.\n\n## 1. Zero-Collection Policy\nDraco is built on a \"Privacy by Default\" architecture. **We (the developers/maintainers) never collect, store, or have access to your data in any way.** The software is entirely self-hosted within your own infrastructure.\n\n## 2. Information Handled During Interactions\nWhen you interact with Draco via chat or messaging (e.g., SMS approvals), you are providing information directly to the instance of the software **you control**. This information is processed in real-time to facilitate your specific requests (such as approving a remediation). \n- **User Consent**: By using these features, you consent to the processing of this information within your own environment.\n- **No Malicious Use**: You agree that you will provide information only for legitimate governance purposes and not for any malicious intent.\n\n## 2. Use of Data\nData collected by Draco is used exclusively for:\n- Detecting cost and security anomalies in your cloud infrastructure.\n- Generating natural language alerts and remediation scripts.\n- Orchestrating multi-channel notifications.\n\n## 3. Third-Party Services\nDraco integrates with the following third-party services. Usage of these services is governed by their respective privacy policies:\n- **Google Gemini**: For AI analysis and remediation generation.\n- **GitHub**: For GitOps workflows and Pull Request management.\n- **Twilio**: For SMS-based alerting and approvals.\n- **SendGrid**: For email notifications.\n\n**Note**: Draco is designed to redact or minimize PII (Personally Identifiable Information) before sending data to AI providers.\n\n## 4. Data Security\nAs a self-hosted tool, the security of the data stored in the Draco database (PostgreSQL) is your responsibility. We recommend:\n- Using encrypted connection strings.\n- Restricting network access to the database.\n- Managing API keys securely via environment variables or secret managers.\n\n## 5. Data Retention\nDraco stores historical scan data in your local or hosted database according to your own retention policies. Draco does not phone home to any centralized telemetry server.\n\n## 6. Your Rights\nSince Draco is self-hosted, you have full control over your data. You may delete or modify any scan history or configuration at any time by accessing your database or configuration files.\n\n## 7.
