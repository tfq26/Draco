# Terms of Service for Draco

**Last Updated: February 17, 2026**

Welcome to **Draco**, an autonomous cloud governance and observability platform. By using this software, you agree to the following terms.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the Draco CLI and associated services (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service
Draco is an open-source sentinel designed to monitor cloud environments, identify anomalies using AI (Google Gemini), and provide automated remediation via GitOps workflows (GitHub).

## 3. Communication and Consent
By configuring and initiating the messaging or chat features of Draco (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid), you explicitly consent to receiving messages from and sending information to the Service. You acknowledge that any information provided during these chat interactions or messaging sessions is provided voluntarily for the purpose of infrastructure governance and remediation.

## 4. User Responsibilities & Security Representations
- **Configuration**: You are responsible for the secure configuration of all environment variables, API keys, and cloud credentials used by Draco.
- **Secure Handling**: You represent and warrant that your environment is secure and that you will not use Draco, or any information processed by it, for any malicious, illegal, or unauthorized purpose.
- **Costs**: You acknowledge that Draco's monitoring and remediation actions may incur costs from third-party providers (e.g., Azure, Google Gemini, Twilio, SendGrid). You are solely responsible for these costs.
- **Review**: While Draco provides automated remediation suggestions, it is your responsibility to review and approve changes (e.g., Pull Requests) to your infrastructure.

## 4. AI and Automated Actions
Draco uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze data and suggest remediations. You acknowledge that:
- AI-generated outputs may contain errors.
- Draco's automated actions are performed at your own risk.
- We are not liable for any infrastructure downtime, data loss, or security vulnerabilities resulting from AI-driven decisions.

## 5. License
Draco is provided under the **MIT License**. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the software in accordance with that license.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DRACO AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE.

## 7. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
